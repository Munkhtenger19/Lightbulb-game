            <p> Once upon a time, King Unnamed of Nowhereland was both smiling
            and crying at the same time. He was smiling because his enormous
            brand-new palace with many spacious rooms and corridors has just
            been finished. He is also crying as these rooms need to be illuminated
            and kept warm, but the ongoing increase of utility costs affect him
            as well. So now it's time to think about the placement of the palace's
            light bulbs. We need to place them so that everything is properly lit,
            but we cannot install any unnecessary bulbs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, please help him to place the light bulbs correctly.
                King will measure your time and please provide him a player name
                of you as he will write down your information.
            </p>

                Happy light saving!
